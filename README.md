# Overview
ArcGIS Runtime API for Android v100.14.1 samples.  The `main` branch of this repository contains sample app modules for the latest available version of the [ArcGIS Runtime API for Android](https://developers.arcgis.com/android/). Samples released under older versions can be found through the [git tags](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-android/tags).  Please read our [wiki](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-android/wiki) for help with working with this repository.

# Prerequisites
* The samples are building with `compileSdkVersion 31`
* [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
* [An ArcGIS Developers API key](https://developers.arcgis.com/android/get-started/#3-get-an-api-key)

## Developer Instructions
Please read our [developer instructions wiki page](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-android/wiki/dev-instructions) to set up your developer environment with Android Studio.  Instructions include forking and cloning the repository for those new to Git.

Once the project is cloned to disk you can import into Android Studio:

* From the Welcome to Android Studio screen, click the **Open** button. (If you're already inside a project, click **File > Open** in the menu bar instead.)
* Navigate to the **arcgis-runtime-samples-android/java** or **arcgis-runtime-samples-android/kotlin** folder and click **OK**.

## Accessing Esri location services
Accessing Esri location services, including basemaps, routing, and geocoding, requires authentication using either an API Key or an ArcGIS identity:
 1. API key: A permanent key that gives your application access to Esri location services. Visit your [ArcGIS Developers Dashboard](https://developers.arcgis.com/dashboard) to create a new API key or access an existing API key.
 
The Android samples in this repository have been structured to use an API key, set once, which will run in all samples. Set your API key in the `gradle.properties` file located in the `/.gradle` folder within your home directory (`/Users/<user_name>/.gradle/gradle.properties`). The API_KEY property should contain quotes around the key itself: `API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"`

2. ArcGIS identity: An ArcGIS named user account that is a member of an organization in ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise.

## Run a sample
Once you have set up your developer environment you can run any sample from within Android Studio by selecting the app module from the **Edit Configurations** drop down and clicking the **Run** button from the toolbar. 

### Build/Run sample from Gradle
You can execute all the build tasks using the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) command line tool. It's available as a batch file for Windows (gradlew.bat) and a shell script for Linux/Mac (gradlew.sh) and it is accessible from the root of the project.  

- Build a debug APK

```
$ ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

- Run the app

**Device**
```
adb -d install path/to/sample.apk
```

Built APK's are saved to **arcgis-runtime-samples-android/[module-name]/build/outputs/apk/**. More information about running apps on devices can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html).

### Run samples through the sample viewer
The samples in this repository can also be viewed in a single sample viewer app. It can be found on the Play Store or [on ArcGIS Online](https://arcgisruntime.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=21ac248ea189406c821400dc28bf686c). If downloading from ArcGIS Online, follow these instructions to run the app locally on your device:
1. Download and unzip the file to get the apk **ArcGIS_Runtime_Sample_Viewer_Android_10010.apk**.
1. Install the APK with adb: 
```
adb -d install path/to/ArcGIS_Runtime_Sample_Viewer_Android_10010.apk
```
