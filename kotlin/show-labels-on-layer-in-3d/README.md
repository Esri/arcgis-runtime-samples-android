## Use case

Labeling features is useful to visually display information or attributes on a scene. For example, city officials or maintenance crews may want to show installation dates of features of a gas network.

## How to use the sample

Pan and zoom to explore the scene. Notice the labels showing installation dates of features in the 3D gas network.

## How it works

1. Create an `ArcGISScene` from a `PortalItem`.
2. Add the scene to an `SceneView` and load it.
3. After loading is complete, obtain the `FeatureLayer` from one of the `GroupLayer`s in the scene's `operationalLayers`.
4. Create an `TextSymbol` to use for displaying the label text.
5. Create an `LabelDefinition` using an  `ArcadeLabelExpression`.
6. Add the definition to the feature layer's `labelDefinitions` array.
7. Set the feature layer's `labelsEnabled` property to `true`.
