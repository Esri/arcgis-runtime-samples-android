# Add graphics renderer

A renderer allows you to change the style of all graphics in a graphics overlay by referencing a single symbol style. A renderer will only effect graphics that do not specify their own symbol style.

## Use case

A renderer allows you to change the style of all graphics in an overlay by only changing one copy of the symbol. For example, a user may wish to display a number of graphics on a map of a parkland which represents trees, all sharing a common symbol.

## How to use the sample

Run the sample and view graphics for points, lines, and polygons, which are stylized using renderers.

## How it works

1. Create a `GraphicsOverlay` and add it to the `MapView`.
2. Create a `Graphic`, specifying only a `Geometry`.
3. Create a single `Symbol` such as a `SimpleMarkerSymbol`.
4. Create a renderer with the `Symbol` such as a `SimpleRenderer(symbol)`.
5. Set the renderer on the `GraphicsOverlay` with `graphicsOverlay.renderer = renderer`.
