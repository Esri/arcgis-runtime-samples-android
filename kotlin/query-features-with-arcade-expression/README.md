Query features on a map using an Arcade expression.

## Use case

Arcade is a portable, lightweight, and secure expression language used to create custom content in ArcGIS applications. Like other expression languages, it can perform mathematical calculations, manipulate text, and evaluate logical statements. It also supports multi-statement expressions, variables, and flow control statements. What makes Arcade particularly unique when compared to other expression and scripting languages is its inclusion of feature and geometry data types. This sample uses an Arcade expression to query the number of crimes in a neighborhood in the last 60 days.

## How to use the sample

Tap on any neighborhood to see the number of crimes in the last 60 days in a callout.

## How it works

1. Create a `PortalItem` using the URL and ID.
2. Create a `ArcGISMap` using the portal item.
3. Set up a listener for taps on the map.
4. Identify the visible layer where it is tapped using `mapView.identifyLayerAsync()` and get the feature.
5. Create the following `ArcadeExpression`:
```kotlin		
expressionValue = "var crimes = FeatureSetByName(\$map, 'Crime in the last 60 days');\n"
                "return Count(Intersects(\$feature, crimes));"
```
            
6. Create an `ArcadeEvaluator` using the Arcade expression and `ArcadeProfile.FORM_CALCULATION`.
7. Create a map of profile variables with the following key-value pairs: 
```kotlin
mapOf<String, Any>("\$feature" to feature, "\$map" to mapView.map)
```
	 
8. Call `ArcadeEvaluator.evaluateAsync()` on the Arcade evaluator object and pass the profile variables map.
9. Get the `ArcadeEvaluationResult.result`.
10. Convert the result to a numerical value (integer) and populate the callout with the crime count.

## About the data

This sample uses the [Crimes in Police Beats Sample](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=539d93de54c7422f88f69bfac2aebf7d) ArcGIS Online Web Map which contains 2 layers for city beats borders, and crimes in the last 60 days as recorded by the Rochester, NY police department.
