# Display content of utility network container

A utility network container allows a dense collection of features to be represented by a single feature, which can be used to reduce map clutter.

## Use case

Offering a container view for features aids in the review for valid structural attachment and containment relationships and helps determine if a dataset has an association role set. Container views often model a cluster of electrical devices on a pole top or inside a cabinet or vault.

## How to use the sample

Tap on a container feature to show all features inside the container. The container is shown as a polygon graphic with the content features contained within. The viewpoint and scale of the map are also changed to the container's extent. Connectivity and attachment associations inside the container are shown as red and blue dotted lines respectively.

## How it works

1. Load a web map that includes ArcGIS Pro [Subtype Group Layers](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/mapping/layer-properties/subtype-layers.htm) with only container features visible (i.e. fuse bank, switch bank, transformer bank, hand hole and junction box).
2. Add a `GraphicsOverlay` for displaying a container view.
3. Create and load a `UtilityNetwork` with the same feature service URL as the layers in the `Map`.
4. Add an event handler for the `onTouchListener` listener of the `MapView`.
5. Identify a feature and create a `UtilityElement` from it.
6. Get the associations for this element using `GetAssociationsAsync(UtilityElement, UtilityAssociationType.CONTAINMENT)`.
7. Turn-off the visibility of all `OperationalLayers`.
8. Get the features for the `UtilityElement`(s) from the associations using `fetchFeaturesForElementsAsync(List<UtilityElement>)`
9. Add a `Graphic` with the same geometry and symbol as these features.
10. Add another `Graphic` that represents this extent and zoom to this extent with some buffer.
11. Get associations for this extent using `GetAssociationsAsync(Envelope)`
12. Add a `Graphic` to represent the association geometry between them using a symbol that distinguishes between `Attachment` and `Connectivity` association type.
13. Turn-on the visibility of all `OperationalLayers`, clear the `Graphics` and zoom out to the previous extent to exit the container view.

## About the data

The [Naperville electric](https://sampleserver7.arcgisonline.com/server/rest/services/UtilityNetwork/NapervilleElectric/FeatureServer) feature service contains a utility network layer used to find associations shown in this sample. The [Naperville electric containers](https://sampleserver7.arcgisonline.com/portal/home/item.html?id=813eda749a9444e4a9d833a4db19e1c8) webmap uses the same feature service endpoint and displays only container features. Authentication is required and handled within the sample code.

## Additional information

Using utility network on ArcGIS Enterprise 10.8 requires an ArcGIS Enterprise member account licensed with the [Utility Network user type extension](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/license-user-type-extensions.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_41D78AD9691B42E0A8C227C113C0C0BF). Please refer to the [utility network services documentation](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/publish-services/windows/utility-network-services.htm).
