## Use case

The [ENC specification](https://docs.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-57Ed3.1/20ApB1.pdf) describes how hydrographic data should be displayed digitally.

An ENC exchange set is a catalog of data files which can be loaded as cells. The cells contain information on how symbols should be displayed in relation to one another, so as to represent information such as depth and obstacles accurately.

## How to use the sample

Run the sample and view the ENC data. Pan and zoom around the map. Take note of the high level of detail in the data and the smooth rendering of the layer.

## How it works

1. Specify the path to a local CATALOG.031 file to create an `EncExchangeSet`.
2. After loading the exchange set, get the `EncDataset` objects in the exchange set with `getDatasets()`.
3. Create an `EncCell` for each dataset. Then create an `EncLayer` for each cell.
4. Add the ENC layer to a map's operational layers collection to display it.

## Relevant API

* EncDataset
* EncExchangeSet
* EncLayer

## Offline Data

1. To use ENC in ArcGIS Runtime, extra resources are required. Download the data [Hydrography Data supplement](https://developers.arcgis.com/downloads/data) from ArcGIS for Developers and [ENC Exchange Set without updates](https://arcgisruntime.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=9d2987a825c646468b3ce7512fb76e2d) from ArcGIS Online.
2. Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file to disk.
3. Open your command prompt and navigate to the folder where you extracted the contents of the data from step 2.
4. Push the data into the scoped storage of the sample app:
 	* `adb push hydrography /Android/data/com.esri.arcgisruntime.sample.addencexchangeset/files/hydrography`
	* `adb push ExchangeSetwithoutUpdates /Android/data/com.esri.arcgisruntime.sample.addencexchangeset/files/ExchangeSetwithoutUpdates`
