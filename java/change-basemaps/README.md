# Change basemaps

Change a map's basemap. A basemap is beneath all layers on an `ArcGISMap` and is used to provide visual reference for the operational layers.

## Use case

Basemaps should be selected contextually. For example in maritime applications it would be more appropriate to use a basemap of the world's oceans, as opposed to a basemap of the world's streets.

## How to use the sample

Use the navigation drawer to select the active basemap from the list of available basemaps.

## How it works

1. Create an `ArcGISMap` object.
2. Set the map to the `MapView` object.
3. Choose a new basemap style and set it on the map.
